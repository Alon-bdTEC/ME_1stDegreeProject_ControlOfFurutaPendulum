# Control of a Furuta Pendulum - Final Project

This project was developed as part of my undergraduate final project at the Technion, in collaboration with my partner Igal Vornov and under the supervision of Prof. Leonid Mirkin.

The system under study consists of a brushed DC motor actuator that drives a rotating arm with a pendulum attached to its end. The project's objectives and stages are as follows:

## Current Progress

### 1. Tracking Control for the Arm Angle
- Initially implemented a simple gain-based tracking controller, which functioned but showed limited performance.
- Improved performance by designing a loop-shaped tracking controller. However, saturation issues (nonlinear behavior) appeared.

### 2. Bang-Bang Reference Signal
- Instead of a smoothed step input, we designed an optimal bang-bang reference signal, resulting in a bang-bang control voltage within specified limits.

### 3. Feedforward Control (2DOF)
- Added feedforward control to improve tracking, reducing overshoot (OS). However, the arm still oscillated at the pendulum's natural frequency.
- To address this, we introduced a damping controller.

### 4. Cascade Control with Damping
- Designed a damping controller layered on top of the tracking controller to suppress pendulum oscillations during arm tracking.
- This cascade structure slightly degraded the tracking controller's performance but overall led to acceptable steady target acquisition in laboratory tests.

### 5. LQG-Based Damping Controller
- Further improved damping by designing a controller based on an LQG (Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian) optimization problem with defined weighting transmission.
- Resulted in a more complex but smoother continuous damping controller with improved suppression performance.

### 6. Switched (Intermittent) Control Implementation
- We are now converting the continuous control into a switched control scheme.
- This involves decomposing the damping controller back into an observer and a state feedback controller, sampling them independently, and using a sample-and-hold structure for the system's state vector.

## Future Plans

- Apply the same methods developed for arm tracking around the lower equilibrium to:
  - Stabilize the pendulum in the upright position.
  - Implement a swing-up controller to move the pendulum from the downward to the upward position.
